White Couple Criticized For Choosing Former Plantation As Venue For Slave Auction

Forced to defend their decision to sell Black people in such a problematic location, local white couple Nate and Caroline Harper faced criticism Tuesday for choosing a former plantation as the venue for their slave auction. “I know it’s considered a bit controversial these days, but ever since I was a little girl, I’ve dreamed of holding my slave auction at a historic plantation,” said Caroline Harper, explaining to reporters that there were only so many venues in Louisiana that could fit all of the people coming to bid on their human chattel. “Sure, we could have held it at the courthouse, but I wanted my slave auction to be special. Some people may think it was an inappropriate setting, but at the end of the day, everybody who came loved buying and selling African Americans at this charming antebellum estate.” At press time, the Harpers had reportedly sent all their slaveholding friends home with personalized “Nate and Caroline” gift bags that included shackles and a bullwhip.

Sen. Menendez’s Wife Offers To Hit Anyone With Her Car In Exchange For Dropping Charges

In an effort to make a deal following a new indictment accusing her and her husband of conspiring to act as foreign agents, Nadine Menendez, wife of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), reportedly offered to hit anyone with her car Tuesday in exchange for having the charges dropped. “If you have a journalist who’s getting a bit nosy or an associate who did you dirty, I can mow them down, no problem—but I need you to do me this one favor,” said Menendez, adding that she’d even make it look like an accident, which prosecutors must know she was good for, and all they would have to do is forget she ever conveyed directives to her husband from the Egyptian government. “Any age, race, gender, religion. It doesn’t matter to me. Just name your mark, and I’ll barrel into them at 85 miles per hour in my new Mercedes. All I ask is that we pretend this whole conspiracy thing never happened. Heck, I’ll even dump the body in the Hudson to sweeten the deal, if that’s what it takes.” At press time, Menendez had reportedly reached a deal with prosecutors after running over her husband.

Psychic Informs Woman That Dead Mother Is Saying Some Pretty Boilerplate Ghost Shit
Midway through a session in which she allegedly channeled the spirit of a departed loved one, local psychic Esme “The Prophetess” Sherwood informed her client Tuesday that her dead mother was saying some pretty boilerplate ghost shit. “What I’m hearing is basically that she’s proud of you, she loves you—you know, all that stuff they always say,” said Sherwood, explaining that her customer’s recently deceased mother was hitting her with every ghost cliché in the book, so it really wasn’t interesting enough to get into specifics. “She knows that you’ll achieve your dreams, she’s at peace now, etc. You pretty much get it. I’ve done so many of these things, and it really is generally the same every time. Your mom is, unsurprisingly, no exception. Blah, blah, blah, she’ll always be watching over you… You know what? I’m not even going to charge you for this one.” At press time, the psychic had reportedly become intrigued after the phantasm suddenly demanded her daughter depart the room immediately and go assassinate the president.

Landlord Forced To Raise Rent Due To Thinking Of Bigger Number

Apologizing to his tenant for circumstances that were beyond his control, local landlord Eddie Turley was reportedly forced Monday to raise the rent due to thinking of a bigger number. “You can re-sign your lease, but I have to raise it by $250 a month because I realized there was a bigger number your rent could be,” Turley informed his tenant of six years, attributing the rent increase to a need to keep up with the rising numbers he could envision. “Look, you’re a good tenant and all, but I thought of a bigger number and that puts me in a bind. Did you know that $2,850 is larger than $2,600? Most tenants don’t concern themselves with things like that, but as a landlord, I always have to be adjusting my leasing requirements to match the larger amounts that happen to come to mind.” The landlord reportedly added that he had thought of a bigger number for the tenant’s pet fee too.

Jewish Man Reassured After Being Told Antisemitism Doesn’t Exist
Expressing a deep sense of relief upon learning that one of the most persistent and insidious prejudices in human history was not real, local Jewish man Dan Applebaum was reportedly reassured Friday after being told antisemitism doesn’t exist. “Wow, this is a huge weight off my chest,” Applebaum said when he heard from a casual acquaintance that his concerns about the millennia-old hatred of the Jewish people were not founded in reality. “Understandably, I took the countless pogroms and genocides against people of my ancestry—and the horrific indifference of non-Jews to that plight—as something to be worried about in my everyday life. But now I realize none of that stuff ever happened. The crazy thing is that all of this made me think that anti-Jewish sentiment was so pervasive it could span not just continents, but even left and right partisan divides. Weird, right? Part of me actually has this distinct memory of antisemitic incidents hitting an all-time high in the United States just last year. But now I see I was completely wrong. And frankly, that’s an enormous comfort to me. I should probably tell my friends and family this news so they can stop crying.” At press time, Applebaum had reportedly drawn further solace upon learning from his acquaintance that the Holocaust was not as big of a deal as most made it out to be.

New Law Requires People Who Publicly Announce They Need To Take A Piss To Register As Sex Offenders
With the passage of a landmark bill that received widespread bipartisan support in Congress and was immediately signed into law by President Biden, a new federal statute requires anyone who publicly announces their need to take a piss to register as a sex offender. “Those who loudly declare to people around them that they are going to ‘take a leak’ will now be charged with a class A misdemeanor and added to their state’s sex offender registry,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a co-sponsor of the bill, who explained that announcing one’s plan to “empty the bladder” or referring to one’s genitals as a lizard that must be drained would result in a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to a year in jail. “Whether you are in a restaurant, bar, or other public area, proclaiming that you need to see a man about a horse is illegal and requires the offender to register annually in person with local authorities for the next five years. In addition, perpetrators found guilty of verbalizing their intention to shake the dew off the lily, whiz like a racehorse, or siphon the python must inform their neighbors of their status as a sex criminal and stay at least 500 feet away from any public toilet.” Cole added that the new law was in line with a current statute that imposes a 20-year prison sentence on anyone who tells others, without their consent, that they are going to “drop the kids off at the pool” or “let loose a deuce from the ol’ caboose.”

Green Giant Introduces New Frozen Death Cap Mushrooms For Convenient Weeknight Murders

They cook in the bag in just under six minutes, so you can spend less time worrying about getting dinner on the table and more time planning how you’re going to get away with it. As Green Giant always says, revenge is a dish best served steamed.” At press time, the product had reportedly been recalled due to reports of survival.

Diplomatic Solution Sounds Fucking Lame

Noting that there were still so many lives to be lost, so much pain to be inflicted, and so much blood to be shed, a new report published Monday by researchers at American University found that when there could be an all-out war, a diplomatic solution sounded pretty fucking lame. “According to our study, in situations where there could be widespread violence and mass casualties on a genocidal scale, signing some kind of cease-fire, peace treaty, or truce sounds like some goddamn pansy shit,” said professor of international relations James Lewis, adding that anyone who looked for a mutually beneficial outcome, sought common ground, or even attempted to temporarily broker peace when an entire group of people could be tortured, murdered, or blown off the face of the planet was an absolute fucking moron. “After researching countless global conflicts across the world over the past millennium, we found that the most boring, weak-willed, limp-dicked thing you could do was put on a suit, write down some mutually agreed upon laws, and then obey those very laws like some kind of child. Seriously, grow up, bolster your military, continue to stoke the flames of conflict, and kill your fellow man in a hate-filled rage like an adult. Diplomacy is for pussies. Blood, blood, blood.” Lewis added that the researchers further found that anyone who sympathized with any individual who lost their life in a conflict—regardless of their gender, age, race, nationality, or religion—was fucking stupid and should be immediately killed as a result.

Moderate U.S. Politician Believes Israel Should Only Kill Half Of Palestinians
Hoping to bring all sides of the issue together, moderate politician Rep. Martin Danforth (D-OH) told reporters Friday that he believed Israel should only kill half of the Palestinians. “This war is a complex issue with valid points across the ideological spectrum, which is why it’s imperative that cooler heads prevail and that Israel limit its slaughter to 50% of the Palestinian population,” said Danforth, arguing that a consensus must be reached to ensure only every other Palestinian family was wiped off the face of the earth. “No one is saying Israel doesn’t have the right to indiscriminately bomb Palestinians, just don’t indiscriminately bomb them all. Some might disagree, but I don’t think it’s so controversial to state that half of all Palestinian men, women, and children should be massacred while the other half is left to live with the trauma.” At press time, Danforth expressed confidence that a diplomatic resolution could be reached that would permit Gaza’s collapsed healthcare system to kill the Palestinians instead of war.

Report: Sitting Down In Barrel Of Water Still Best Way To Put Out Fire On Ass
Issuing its annual safety recommendations for preventing fire-related injury, the National Fire Protection Association released an updated report Thursday confirming that sitting down in a barrel of water remains the best way to put out a fire on one’s ass. “By far, the most effective method for extinguishing an ass fire is to immediately seek out the nearest basin of water and plunge into it ass-first,” the report read in part, explaining that the immersion of one’s backside in a large cylindrical container filled with water was three times more successful at reducing a buttocks blaze than hitting the flames with a rolled-up towel, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the origin of the fire. “If you’re not sure that your ass is on fire, warning signs include shooting straight up into the air with a ‘yeee-owwww’ as well as smelling something burning and then realizing the odor is from your own behind going up in flames. To ensure the ass fire is completely out, make sure to keep it submerged in the liquid until you hear a sizzle and let out a relieved sigh. This will not, however, prevent your pants from burning away and leaving a viewing window for your charred visible butt cheeks. Obviously, the best solution is always prevention, so please be mindful of how close your bottom is coming to the lit end of a dynamite stick and keep a safe distance.” At press time, the NFPA had released companion guidelines for preventing a piranha from biting one’s ass while it was submerged in the water.

Toyota Unveils New Bitter Coating To Prevent Children From Swallowing Cars
Noting that the colorful, shiny vehicles are far more toxic than they appear, Toyota officials announced Wednesday that the company has created a new bitter coating to prevent children from swallowing cars. “Thanks to this state-of-the-art denatonium benzoate coating, children will be far more deterred from putting entire automobiles into their mouths,” said CEO Kōji Satō, adding that, previously, it was not uncommon for an unsupervised child to find a vehicle, swallow it whole, and end up in the emergency room. “The truth is, even ingesting a car part like a carburetor, exhaust pipe, or gasket could quickly lead to sickness or even death. But now, if a child tries to eat a Corolla, Prius, or even a Highlander, they’ll immediately spit out the vehicle onto the road, where it belongs.” At press time, Satō added that as an extra precaution, all Toyotas would also be sold in thick childproof plastic packaging.

Study Finds Charismatic Americans Experiencing Friendship Epidemic
A new study published Wednesday by researchers at Columbia University found that charismatic Americans are experiencing a friendship epidemic. “The data shows that captivating and social people have started acquiring an alarming number of friends and acquaintances—more than they know what to do with,” said lead researcher Jared McKinney, explaining that an increasing number of charming people who are easy to be around are struggling under the pressure of keeping up with all the events on their social calendars. “Sadly, we are seeing this happen more and more due to the ease at which these fascinating individuals can receive invites through social media. Fortunately, there are only a few million interesting Americans who anyone would want to be friends with, but as those people are in high demand, they often spend entire weekends partying with various companions.” McKinney added that if anyone knows a person who could be at risk, they should absolutely not reach out and let them spend a night in to recover.

Pentagon Accuses China Of Being Chinese
Claiming to have acquired enough evidence to support the allegations, Pentagon officials held a press conference Wednesday to accuse China of being Chinese. “After a years-long investigation, we now have corroboration from numerous witnesses that China is definitely Chinese,” said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, explaining that surveillance shows the rival superpower has been amassing millions of Chinese people within its borders. “We have always suspected that China might be Chinese, but now we have discovered that President Xi Jinping and past leaders have been secretly letting Chinese ideology run rampant in their country for years. They’ve even gone so far as to invent an entire Chinese language and history; what else could they be hiding?” At press time, Pentagon officials claimed the situation had reached a level of concern they had not felt since they first suspected Russia of being Russian.

Increasingly Powerful Trans Person Capable Of Using Every Single Bathroom At Once
As the influence of the nation’s transgender individuals continues to encroach on the freedoms of the U.S. populace, sources confirmed Tuesday that increasingly powerful trans person Tori Randall is now capable of using every single bathroom in the country at once. “Tori has become so trans that she can enter every single bathroom in the continental United States simultaneously, and there’s absolutely nothing anyone can do to stop her,” said Cincinnati city officials in a statement echoed by officials in thousands of other towns and cities across the nation, where every single stall in both public and private bathrooms is being currently occupied under the formidable capacities of the single trans individual. “This is what happens when there’s not enough legislation to keep transgender people out of our bathrooms. Now she’s in every women’s bathroom and every men’s bathroom. She’s in our bathroom and your bathroom. She’s in bathrooms in every country club even though she’s not a member; she’s in every stall at JFK Airport even though she doesn’t have a flight. Her piss and shit are at this very moment traveling down the drains of every single bathroom at every single billionaire’s gated mansion, and there are billions of U.S. toilets all flushing at once. She doesn’t need the code at Starbucks. She can travel through bathroom walls. Soon, as the trans community becomes increasingly confident in its omnipotent abilities, we could see them all develop the capacity to bend the laws of space-time, at least as far as bathrooms are concerned. We should all be very, very afraid.” At press time, reports confirmed the trans person’s powers had only grown as she used every last drop of water in the Northern Hemisphere to wash her hands.

Scientists Announce That Unexplored Parts Of Ocean Probably Contain More Water
Advancing a bold new theory that could revolutionize the way scientists think about the planet, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced Monday that the unexplored parts of the world’s oceans probably contain more water. “While we can’t say with certainty what lay in those deep recesses of the sea we have yet to observe firsthand, chances are there’s a bunch of water in there,” said Adrian Yu, an MIT professor who along with his colleagues spent decades studying what is considered one of the great mysteries of science before concluding the unseen reaches of the ocean are likely full of water, as well as waves, tides, and, in the colder regions, ice. “We’re pretty sure the water is salt water, too. If you go deep enough, there might also be sand or mud down there, but more research is needed before we can say definitely. It’s all pretty standard ocean stuff, though.” Leading oceanographers hailed the finding, calling it the greatest advancement in the field since last year’s discovery of a sophisticated undersea civilization of tiny merfolk who ride around on seahorses and talk to dolphins.

Biden Announces Nation’s Vibrators Will Buzz At 2 P.M. Today In Test Of Emergency Stimulation Program
Spreading the word ahead of time so that Americans wouldn’t be caught off guard, President Joe Biden announced that all of the nation’s vibrators would buzz at 2 p.m. today in a test of the Emergency Stimulation Program. “This routine test of the ESP will be automatically directed to every consumer vibrator in the country, which will simultaneously begin to emit quivering pulses until the stimulation drill is over,” said the commander in chief, noting that citizens should turn off any wands, plugs, bullets, or other electric dildos ahead of the test if they didn’t plan on becoming aroused at that time. “Remember, it’s only a test, so you will not be required to climax at this time. This is merely a safeguard to ensure the federal government can reach your erogenous zones if we ever need to quickly and effectively get you all off. We just want to be prepared in case, God forbid, one of our foreign adversaries ever threatens to make you come harder than we do.” The White House later released an Emergency Stimulation Program fact sheet detailing the creation of the national network of sexual pleasure devices during the Cold War, when the country was in a heated race with the Soviet Union to develop the world’s first military-grade fuck machine.

Overinvestment In Alternative Energy Accidentally Plunges Earth Into Ice Age

Bemoaning the hubris that had led humanity to this pitiable state, researchers confirmed Thursday that overinvestment in alternative energy had plunged the earth into a sixth ice age. “We knew all along that the rapid deployment of solar, geothermal, and wind energy would reduce global temperatures to dangerous lows, but we couldn’t stop ourselves—and now there’s an ice sheet encasing all of Canada,” said University of Washington climate scientist Gwendolyn Brufke, shivering and exhaling visible mist in a subzero conference room as she described the direct correlation between switching to electric cars and the Manhattan skyline disappearing beneath heavy snowfall earlier this week. “It happened so quickly that it felt like there was no way to stop the mass die-off of nearly every mammal on the planet from hypothermia. But of course, we could have stopped it. All we had to do was burn a little more coal and keep up the fracking leases. But we were too greedy, too dead set on switching over to renewable energy sources. Now we’re paying the price.” At press time, Brufke had reportedly collapsed from exposure and was slowly succumbing to the elements as she insisted that anyone who was listening take her death as a warning to switch back to burning natural gas.

Commander Biden Gnaws Washington Monument Down To Slobber-Covered Stub
Noting that there was no excuse for the first dog’s most recent instance of bad behavior, the White House confirmed Thursday that Commander Biden had gnawed the Washington Monument down to a slobber-covered stub. “We turn our backs for two minutes, and boom, we find Commander sitting there on the National Mall with the entire Washington Monument in his mouth,” said White House aide Paul Stephens, adding that no matter how much they attempted to distract the dog with treats, tried to pry his mouth open with their hands, or yelled “Drop it,” the 2-year-old German shepherd continued to growl and bite enormous chunks of cement off the 555-foot tall obelisk. “While we love Commander, we cannot continue to allow him to misbehave, especially after he took what remained of the monument and tried to hide it under a rug in the West Wing. This is almost as bad as when he tore apart the Lincoln Memorial in search of a squeaker. We will not let this happen again.” At press time, sources confirmed Commander Biden had a bad case of the runs and was defecating chunks of cement all over the Reflecting Pool.

Texas Science Class Features Day Where Kids Can Execute Real-Life Inmate
In what many were calling the most exciting day of the whole school year, a group of Texas fifth-graders reportedly spent their science class Wednesday executing real-life inmates. “It was so cool! We each got to put on rubber gloves, strap our guy to the chair, and then inject him with a lethal dose of potassium chloride,” said Anthony Hernandez, a student at Oak Canyon Elementary School, adding that he and his lab partner had a blast, despite the fact that they made a real mess of their 46-year-old convicted felon while they were trying to find his jugular vein. “Some of my friends got pretty squeamish, but I loved that it took an hour for mine to die. Plus, for the ones where the drugs didn’t take, our teacher gave us guns and we got to do a firing squad. It was awesome.” At press time, the class could be heard screaming after one of the students discovered that the death row inmate she’d just killed was pregnant.

New App Connects Users Too Tired To Get Out Of Bed With Gig Worker Who Will Turn Off Their Lights
Touting the on-demand service as a great convenience for anyone who finds themselves exhausted at the end of a long day, a widely hyped new startup unveiled an app Tuesday that connects users who are too tired to get out of bed with a gig worker who will turn off their lights for them. “With the Flip app, users can contact a person who will enter their home at any hour and turn off their bedroom light when they don’t have the energy to do it themselves,” said Flip’s lead developer, Mason Reynolds, explaining that once users had logged in, they would be able to select up to five lighting fixtures or appliances that were out of arm’s reach and summon one of the dozens of ‘Flippers’ in their area to come to their residence and flip the switches to the off position. “Service rates range anywhere from $5 to $30 based on Flipper availability, time of night, and how high the pull chains are on ceiling lights. Plus, users can choose to upgrade to FlipXL if they’d like to have a gig worker hand them the remote control when it’s way across the room.” Reynolds stressed that the Flip app was currently available only to users who had enough foresight to put their phone within reach before they lay down.

54-Year-Old Facebook User Wins Nobel Prize For Own Extensive Internet Research Into Dangers Of Covid Vaccine
Lauding the man as one of the greatest minds working in medicine today, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences reportedly awarded 54-year-old Facebook user Darren Weston the Nobel Prize Monday for his own extensive internet research into the dangers of Covid vaccinations. “We are proud to announce that the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine will be awarded to insurance broker and Findlay, OH resident Darren Weston for his astounding discoveries that vaccines don’t work and will kill you,” said Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel Committee, who congratulated Weston on his dozens of hours of hard work trawling Google search results and anonymous internet forums for evidence that only a crazy person would stick one of those things in their arms. “Without his dedication to advancing scientific research, there would be hundreds of Facebook users who still had no idea that the vaccine is both poison and a scam. He managed to do all this while overcoming countless obstacles, such as the gauntlet of criticism from his sister-in-law and 18-year-old nephew. Mr. Weston is also responsible for being the first person to discover that vaccines cause autism.” At press time, Weston rejected the prize on account of it being linked to globalism.

Report: U.S. Economy Loses $5 Billion Every Year To Americans Rising For National Anthem
Concluding that the patriotic gesture was a significant drain on the country’s resources, a new report out Monday from researchers at Georgetown University found that the U.S. economy loses $5 billion every year to Americans rising for the national anthem. “According to our estimates, standing for ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ is draining our economy of $5 billion that would otherwise be earned from spectators checking important emails or going to the concession stand to buy another soft pretzel,” said economist Roland Mussa, whose calculations determined the average American spent nearly seven hours a year moving from standing to sitting and another 20 hours attempting to remove their hats. “Whether it’s at a Little League game or the Super Bowl, the national anthem is costing us dearly. In the moment, it might not feel like it takes very long, but those seconds add up. Just imagine how much more robust our economy could be if we didn’t have to rise at all.” At press time, Mussa added that his calculations did not even begin to account for the trillions of dollars lost when singers paused after the words “O’er the land of the free.”

Wyoming Announces It Now Adults Only

Noting that the new legislation would go into effect almost immediately, Wyoming officials announced Monday that the state would now be adults only. “Wyoming is now a child-free zone,” said Gov. Mark Gordon (R), explaining that children currently inside of the Western state’s borders would have until 6 p.m. to vacate the premises, with no exceptions, at which point Wyoming would officially become “The Grown-Up State.” “Frankly, Wyomingites are sick and tired of parents thinking that the whole world wants to be near their loud, annoying brats. Enough already! Having kids may be right for a state like Iowa, but it’s not for us. We like a clean, clutter-free territory where we are free to curse and smoke. And they’re not as cute as you think they are, sorry. If you currently have children in state, you are welcome to stay—only your children have to relocate. Try Montana.” Gov. Gordon added that the state would immediately cease funding public education and instead be using tax revenue to buy a hot tub.

Fox News Host Outraged By Viral Video Of Mob Of Thugs Using Coupons To Save Money
Saying the footage clearly showed the chaos that Democratic leadership had created in cities across the country, Fox News host Jesse Watters expressed outrage Monday at a viral video showing a mob of thugs using coupons to save money. “Look at the tape, people, these are essentially roaming gangs out there barging into Walgreens, Dollar General, and Walmart and using coupons to force defenseless cashiers to give them a dollar off on mouthwash,” said a visibly agitated Watters of the widely-viewed footage compilation showing customers at local supermarkets and pharmacies using coupons to purchase assorted home goods and cosmetics at a significant discount. “It’s absolutely disgusting liberals are letting them get away with this. Saving 50 cents on every package of cough drops they can get their grubby hands on? What kind of banana republic are we living in? Does a price mean nothing in these lawless zones? What’s even worse is these criminals—and let’s call them what they are, folks—act like they’re entitled to a low, low deal on foil baking pans just because they cut out some piece of paper. It’s madness. Every American who cares about safety should be out there protesting and calling their Congressperson about this.” At press time, Watters had expressed relief after a Dick’s Sporting Goods cashier who watched his program shot a customer for entering the store and attempting to use a coupon to buy tennis balls.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Trailblazer In Being Old, Dead At 90
Having been alive as far back as 1933, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a trailblazer in being old, died Thursday night at age 90. “Sen. Feinstein, born Dianne Goldman, started off young but through hard work and dedication rose through the ranks to become very, very old,” said the late Democrat’s chief of staff, James Sauls, who in prepared remarks to reporters cited Feinstein’s many career highlights, such as turning 88 years old in 2021, turning 89 years old in 2022, and, just this year, turning 90. “Her remarkable persistence as the oldest sitting U.S. senator made her a role model to nonagenarians everywhere. Across the nation tonight, little girls will find inspiration in her story, knowing that they, too, can one day grow up to be incredibly old.” Sauls added that while Feinstein did not fulfill her longtime goal of clinging to power in the Senate as long as her late mentor in aging, the 100-year-old Strom Thurmond, she nonetheless spent her final years shattering expectations for what an unbelievably infirm and exhausted person can and should do.

U.S. Mint Releases Collection Of Coins Featuring Child Molester From Every State
Unveiling a commemorative series created in honor of the nation’s most renowned pedophiles, the U.S. Mint announced the release Friday of a new collection of coins that featured a child molester from every state in the union. “This fun, collectible currency showcases each state’s most iconic child sexual predator and begins this month with the release of R. Kelly’s Illinois coin,” said the mint’s director, Ventris C. Gibson, who also unveiled the vinyl display case that enthusiasts could use to show off their collection to friends once they had acquired all 50. “Each month that follows will see the circulation of a new coin, including Jeffrey Epstein of New York, Jerry Sandusky of Pennsylvania, Larry Nassar of Michigan, and former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Massachusetts. Some states had so many notorious child molesters we could hardly settle on just one, so the abusers of underage teens in California, for example, are all represented together by the Hollywood sign.” Gibson added that one of the most interesting parts of the project was the mint’s decision to leave the nickel unchanged, keeping Thomas Jefferson right there where he’s always been.

Trader Joe’s Adds New Fitting Rooms Where Customers Can See How Food Will Look In Their Mouth
Announcing that renovations had been made to all 560 locations, grocery chain Trader Joe’s confirmed this week that they had added fitting rooms so customers could see how their food would look in their mouths. “Too often, a customer will arrive back home with their fresh Trader Joe’s finds only to discover that the butter croissant they purchased is too big or too small for their mouths,” said CEO Bryan Palbaum, who confirmed that every Trader Joe’s store would now feature gender-segregated men’s and women’s fitting rooms each able to accommodate up to 12 shoppers at a time. “We heard your complaints, and we listened. Now, you can know before you buy whether that falafel wrap will look flattering peeking out from your lips, or perhaps you want to confirm that guacamole really is your color. Whatever the reason, if you decide you are not satisfied with the product, simply spit it out and hand it over to a Trader Joe’s fitting room attendant who can make sure it goes back on the shelf where it belongs.” At press time, Palbaum added that to prevent shoplifting, security tags had been added to every product.

Released U.S. Soldier Won’t Shut Up About North Korean Candy

Claiming that the Army private looks for any opportunity to mention the sweets, sources confirmed Thursday that released U.S. soldier Travis King won’t shut up about North Korean candy. “He goes on and on about the sugar-coated peanut candy being so much better than anything he’s ever had in the States,” said military correctional officer Ramon Vega, adding that despite all attempts to turn the conversations back to the detainee’s friends and family, King kept raving about the how the type of sugar in the candy was much tastier than what people used in America. “He tells us they have this hard candy in North Korea that’s kind of sweet and milky, but also a bit salty, which I’ve now heard about a dozen times. Oh, and if I tell him to talk about something else, he goes into how the sesame crackers are just to die for—it’s basically ruined all snacks for me.” Vega added that King was offering to share his Rakhwasaeng with them if they ordered some off eBay for him.

SNAP Recipients Now Required To Show Starvation-Induced Organ Failure
Claiming the plan would ensure benefits went toward those who truly needed them, a new proposal by San Francisco Mayor London Breed would require Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients to demonstrate starvation-induced organ failure. “Starting today, all those applying for food stamp assistance will have to undergo an examination to prove they are medically malnourished and on the brink of death,” said Breed, adding that applicants would need to present evidence that several major organs, including their kidneys, heart, and lungs, could no longer function. “Sadly, we discovered that many people receiving SNAP benefits appeared to be alive and functioning, and were nowhere near the threshold of being so sick from weeks of constant, unrelenting hunger that they could no longer digest solid food. But going forward, unless city residents can show they are currently so emaciated they are slipping in and out of a coma, we will no longer help them. The more irreversible the damage, the better.” At press time, the mayor added that she would be cracking down after authorities discovered that several applicants had fraudulently attempted to use health records taken from a man who had starved to death.

Whole Foods Closes 6 More Stores After Customer Tries Blueberry Without Paying For It
Ascribing the decision to prioritizing the safety of the chain’s employees and customers, grocery retailer Whole Foods announced Thursday that they would be closing 6 more stores across the country after a customer tried a blueberry without paying for it. “If someone takes even one more blueberry, we’ll be forced to permanently shut down every Whole Foods on the West Coast,” said CEO Jason Buechel, who confirmed the company would be closing stores in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle due to the incident in which the berry was sampled at a location in Boston. “When we first opened these locations many months ago, we never envisioned that someone might decide to stick their fingers into a carton and try a berry without paying for it. We understand this might affect shoppers, but unfortunately, we are not equipped to deal with this kind of chaos. We’re simply not capable of weathering these kinds of losses.” At press time, the company confirmed that going forward, their remaining locations would not sell produce at all.

Debuting what the company described as a completely-new way to enjoy the brand’s signature boxed dinners, packaged food product mainstay Hamburger Helper unveiled a line of erotic casseroles Thursday that is intended to be eaten off naked bodies. “No date night would be complete without Hamburger Helper’s new sensual, savory blend of powdered cheese and spices, specially formulated to be licked clean from your partner’s chest, thighs, or…anywhere your desires may take you,” read a press release from parent company Eagle Foods, which went on to state that in only 30 minutes, consumers would be lying down for an intimate meal of elbow macaroni, ground beef, and rehydrated onions ladled over their lover “from head to toe.” “While Hamburger Helper remains America’s favorite no-fuss, one-pan dinner for the whole family, the all-new Hamburger Helper Pure Ecstasy is meant to be enjoyed by consenting adults 18 or older. These steamy, sizzling-hot casserole blends come in classic flavors like Deluxe Beef Stroganoff, Cheesy Italian Shells, and Cheesy Ranch Burger, but with seductive new pasta shapes chosen with the sexy curves of the human form in mind. Plus, no dishes to clean afterward—only sheets.” The press release confirmed the erotic casserole’s box would include step-by-step instructions on how to blindfold one’s partner and titillatingly dribble hot grease on their chest.

Triumphant Biden Announces U.S. Has Killed Man Who Kind Of Looks Like Osama Bin Laden
Delivering a jubilant address to the American people, a triumphant President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the United States had killed a man who kind of looked like Osama bin Laden. “I am proud to stand before you and report that the U.S. Special Operations Command has carried out a mission that killed a guy who is pretty much a dead ringer for Osama bin Laden,” said the president, explaining that intelligence channels were able to independently verify that the man who was taken out in a midnight raid was in fact the late al-Qaeda leader’s doppelgänger. “I want to congratulate Seal Team 6 for their bravery during the raid of the bin Laden look-alike’s Tampa Bay, FL compound, where they neutralized the target with lethal force. We got him, ladies and gentlemen, whoever he is.” Biden added that the man who looked like bin Laden had in his residence the exact same cache of pornography that the real bin Laden had in his possession at the time of his death.

Historians Reveal Original Draft Of Constitution Included 593 Mentions Of Spiders
WASHINGTON—In a finding that sheds light on the particular concerns and interests of the Founding Fathers, historians at the National Archives revealed this week that the original draft of the U.S. Constitution included 593 mentions of spiders. “Early renditions of the Constitution show us that James Madison and the nation’s other Founders seemed to view spiders as one of America’s main threats and, interestingly, potential allies,” said constitutional historian Lawrence Marks, who pointed to discarded clauses in the formative document that repeatedly described spiders as “eight-legged demons” and “web-spinning angels,” explaining that these were clear signs the Founders believed the nation would fail without directly addressing the issue of spiders. “They were quite careful to outline the powers delineated to the spider branch of government, which you’ll see in the now-discarded Article VIII. Most intriguingly, you can look to the ambiguously worded Clause 1 of Section 2, which said American citizens had the right to own as many spiders as they wanted. There’s also the Bill of Rights’ so-called Arachnid Clause, which mostly consists of the word ‘spiders’ repeated several hundred times with period etchings of spiders in the margins. Eventually, of course, the document’s drafters decided to remove virtually all of this language due to Benjamin Franklin’s concerns that it gave too many rights to spiders.” Marks went on to discuss a rudimentary map from the period that was created by the Founding Fathers and that labeled each of the original 13 states as “Spiderville.”

New Feel-Good TikTok Ad Campaign Features Stalker Who Would Have Never Met Child Bride Without App
TikTok has reportedly generated support and approval this week with its feel-good new ad campaign featuring a stalker who would have never met his child bride without the app. “Thanks, TikTok—because of you, I found my virgin bride,” said the thirtysomething TikTok user, referring to the visibly frightened little girl sitting in his lap as upbeat pop music drowned out her pleas for help in Romanian. “TikTok is the place where you can make connections and meet new people, and it’s where I first encountered Vasilia. Of course, she wasn’t the only young woman willing to marry me, but through TikTok’s lax moderation policies I was able to contact her father and buy her from him. She’s the love of my life, and if she ever tries to stray, I’ll kill her. You’re the best, TikTok!” Another feel-good ad in the campaign reportedly features the young child bride doing makeup tutorials while sobbing.

Penniless, Barefoot David Zaslav Wanders L.A. Streets After Reaching Deal With WGA
Meagerly rattling a tin cup at pedestrians rushing past him on Sunset Boulevard, the penniless and barefoot Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav was seen wandering the L.A. streets Monday after reaching a tentative deal with the striking members of the Writers Guild of America. “I’m ruined, please—I have nothing left,” said Zaslav, who wore tattered rags and appeared not to have bathed as he turned his pockets out in disappointment and then warmed his hands before a trash can fire, standing alongside Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peter while the men gazed up at their former penthouse offices, now occupied by recently minted billionaire television and film writers. “Those cold, selfish word magnates took everything from me. They won’t stop until they own all of Hollywood, will they? Please, sir, madam, can you spare one little producer credit to get me back on my feet? All I’ve left is a single bean for supper.” At press time, the bean had reportedly been crushed under the bejeweled scepter of a monocle-clad writer for Abbott Elementary.

Nobel Prize In Physics Awarded To God
Honoring the deity’s transformational and enduring contributions to the scientific field, the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded Monday to God, our Creator, who devised the Heavens and the Earth in all their brilliance. “This prize recognizes the Lord’s foundational work in developing the sun, the moon, and all the manifold stars in the cosmos,” said Hans Olsson, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, who went on to praise the elegance of God’s insight in separating the day and night, thereby developing the very concept of time, without which physics itself would be functionally meaningless. “Beyond that, this year’s laureate also created the laws of physics, which continue to be of inestimable importance to the field. In that sense, this is really long overdue.” At press time, God’s Nobel Prize had been rescinded after it was discovered that He had taken credit for the work of Lise Meitner, the late Austrian physicist who first created light and set the universe into motion but was overlooked for the prize because she was a woman.

Lauren Boebert Offers To Personally Jerk Off Any Constituents She Offended

In an effort to address voters hurt by recent actions that resulted in her being thrown out of a theatrical performance, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) announced Friday that she would personally jerk off any constituents she offended. “In the past week, I’ve heard from many supporters who were concerned by my behavior in recently released footage, which is why I’m offering to make things good between us by jacking you off,” said Boebert, instructing supporters to contact her office with proof of Colorado residency and she would personally travel to their home to deliver an on-the-house tugjob. “As a disclaimer, I will be wearing a latex glove and you need to wipe yourself off afterwards. I’m not going to do that. I’m serious about making amends, however, so feel free to rest your hand on my breasts, if necessary. Just know that this a one week only deal. So get in touch soon.” At press time, Boebert also warned her constituents that she planned to vape the entire time.
