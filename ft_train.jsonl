But it has also been viewed with growing skepticism, especially in Western capitals where governments are wary of Beijing\u2019s global ambitions.\nThe massive undertaking has been plagued by criticism. Beijing has been accused of straddling developing countries with crippling debt, while its sprawling projects have often faced concerns \u2013 and even protests \u2013 over their environmental costs, labor violations and corruption scandals.\nA decade on, Xi\u2019s global building spree is at a crossroads. Chinese investment in BRI projects has tapered off as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy slows. Recipient countries are struggling more than ever to repay their debts amid global economic headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, the United States, which sees the BRI as a a tool for Beijing to extend its global influence at the expense of American power, has proposed its own investment program to boost global infrastructure development.\nIn the Chinese capital, security has been tightened, with road closures and a heavy police presence as leaders and delegations from around the world arrived.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not suspected to be fake."}]}

The company has owned the site in Craighead County for 35 years, he added.\nThe order is Arkansas\u2019 first enforcement action under a state law passed this year that prohibits certain foreign parties from acquiring or holding land. China is among the prohibited parties because it is subject to U.S. arms export controls known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said.\nA rival of U.S. company Corteva (CTVA.N) and German firms BASF (BASFn.DE) and Bayer (BAYGn.DE), Swiss agrichemicals and seeds group Syngenta was bought for $43 billion by ChemChina in 2017 and folded into Sinochem Holdings Corp in 2021. ChemChina is a \u201cstate-owned enterprise\u201d in China, Griffin said.\nSyngenta is now pursuing an initial public offering in Shanghai.\nIf Syngenta fails to sell its land, owned by subsidiary Northrup King Seed Co, Griffin can \u201cforce them to get out of our state\u201d with legal action, Huckabee Sanders said. The state also fined Syngenta $280,000 for failure to report foreign ownership in a timely manner.\nIn a form filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the property last year, Syngenta said: \u201cUltimately, the foreign person that holds indirectly a significant interest in the person owning the land is from China,\u201d according to a copy of the document posted by Griffin\u2019s office.\nBut no one from China has ever directed Syngenta executives to buy, lease or otherwise engage in U.S. land acquisitions, Das said. Since Syngenta had Chinese ownership, the company has purchased an additional 200 agricultural acres (80 hectares), he said.\n\u201cAll Syngenta land holdings have been examined by the U.S. government, through two administrations, as Syngenta was transitioning to ChemChina ownership,\u201d Das said.\nForeign persons held an interest in approximately 40 million acres (16.2 million hectares) of U.S. agricultural land as of Dec. 31, 2021, the USDA said. That was 3.1% of all privately held agricultural land and 1.8% of all land.

Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, examined a wide range of costs beyond immediate wildfire damage, including impacts to real estate value; premature deaths and health risks from wildfire smoke; threats to watersheds; and income loss. The report was shared first with CNN.\nThe range Heinrich\u2019s committee found, which was adjusted for inflation, is significantly higher than a Trump administration report that examined fewer impacts and found the annual cost for wildfires was between $87.4 and $427.8 billion.\n\u201cThe topline numbers are scary,\u201d Heinrich told CNN. \u201cEven if you live someplace where wildfire has never been an issue, these are numbers that are big enough to be systemically problematic for the economy.\u201d\nHeinrich said he and his staff wanted to look at the cascading economic costs from wildfires \u2013 including effects that continue long after a fire has been extinguished \u2013 and make a case for why lawmakers and officials should spend money proactively on resilience measures.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been this frame from some policymakers that we can\u2019t afford to do anything about climate change,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cAnd the reality is, the real costs to our economy are to not do anything about it, and let this run away to an even worse outcome down the road.\u201d\nThe diminished US real estate value is by far the largest portion of the total cost. The report estimates real estate has suffered anywhere from $67.5 to $337.5 billion a year due to wildfires. In comparison, the report estimates insurance payouts for wildfire damage at $14.8 billion per year, and annual premium increases around $1.6 billion.\nBut the figures are also uncertain because the impact on real estate markets is just starting to be understood, an outside expert said.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not suspected to be fake."}]}
