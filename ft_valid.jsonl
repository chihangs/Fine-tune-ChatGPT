New users in the testing region who opt out of premium and the annual subscription will only be able to read posts, watch videos and follow accounts \u2014 but not interact on the platform.

As an added incentive, premium users receive a blue checkmark, have their posts boosted by the platform\u2019s algorithm and are eligible to receive payments as part of X\u2019s new ad revenue share program.\nIt also comes after Musk made a vague statement in a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month suggesting he could start charging all users. He said the company is \u201cmoving to have a small monthly payment for use of the X system\u201d because it is \u201cthe only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots.\u201d\nExperts, however, have said that many bad actors are more than willing and able to pay up for inauthentic accounts on the platform. In theory, a person could also pay to verify an account and then allow a computer to run it, thus effectively creating an automated (or \u201cbot\u201d) verified account.\nX has come under fire in the past week over false and misleading claims that have been widely shared on the platform related to the Israel-Hamas war. The European Commission last week formally opened an investigation into X after a previous warning about disinformation and illegal content on its platform linked to the conflict.\nX says it has removed \u201chundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts,\u201d taken down thousands of posts since the attack on Israel by Hamas and ramped up Community Notes, its program that allows users to fact check other users\u2019 posts. \u201cX is\u2026 addressing identified fake and manipulated content during this constantly evolving and shifting crisis,\u201d X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a letter to EU Commissioner Thiery Breton last week.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not suspected to be fake."}]}
