Authorities are hunting for a man suspected in the killing of a judge who’d heard his divorce case hours earlier

Authorities are searching for a man accused in the fatal shooting of a judge who’d presided hours earlier over a hearing in his divorce case, according to Maryland authorities and court records.

Pedro Argote, 49, is suspected in the killing Thursday of County Circuit Court Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said.

Argote may be driving a silver 2009 Mercedes GL450 with Maryland plates, the agency said. He is 5-foot-7 and 130 pounds with black hair and brown eyes.

The public should “not approach him but to immediately notify law enforcement,” authorities said.

Wilkinson was killed in a shooting in a driveway in the northern Maryland city of Hagerstown, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies responding around 8 p.m. found Wilkinson in a residential driveway suffering from what appeared to be gunshot wounds, it said.

A classic El Niño winter is expected this year, forecasters say. Here’s what that means for snow and cold


El Niño will drive what could be a warmer or wetter winter in parts of the US this year, according to an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday.

But don’t worry, snow lovers. El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – could also mean higher snow chances in some atypical spots and fuel more potent northeast snowstorms, forecasters say.

El Niño is forecast to be strong this winter and reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño fostered the warmest winter on record across the US mainland during 2015-2016, according to NOAA.

While no two El Niño winters are the same, this shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the north becomes drier and warmer.

And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter. Above-average temperatures are likely across much of the northern US, according to NOAA’s outlook.

Arraignment for suspect charged with killing Tupac Shakur delayed another 2 weeks

The 60-year-old man arrested in the killing of rapper Tupac Shakur appeared in Las Vegas court for the second time Thursday, where a judge again delayed his arraignment on a murder charge for another two weeks.

Duane Keith Davis, known as “Keffe D,” was first expected to be arraigned two weeks ago on a charge of murder with use of a deadly weapon in a gang-related homicide stemming from the fatal September 7, 1996, shooting. In that hearing, Judge Tierra D. Jones agreed to delay his arraignment until Thursday so Davis could arrange for his attorney to be present.

But when Davis appeared in court Thursday – shackled at his hands and feet and wearing a navy prison jumpsuit – his attorney Ross Goodman again asked for a two-week continuance for the arraignment and for confirmation of Davis’ attorney of record.

“I’m going to give you two weeks,” Jones said, “but in two weeks we’ve got to get this case moving.”

Davis, next due in court on November 2, plans to plead not guilty, Goodman told reporters after the hearing.

Davis is accused of orchestrating the shooting that cut short the life of Shakur, a 25-year-old trailblazer whose brief, prolific career cemented his legacy as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of all time. His untimely death added a grim layer to that mystique, and for years it had been the subject of conspiracy theories.

In a news conference after Davis’ initial court hearing, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson stressed Davis is presumed innocent until proven otherwise.

Newly released video shows moments before a recently exonerated man was fatally shot by a deputy during a traffic stop


Two months after the state of Florida formally apologized to Leonard Cure for the 16 years he lost following a wrongful conviction for armed robbery, authorities say he was fatally shot Monday by a sheriff’s deputy during a traffic stop just across the state line in Georgia.

“He and his family deserved better,” the Innocence Project of Florida said in a statement. “Lenny’s life mattered.”

Cure’s quest to rebuild his life after being wrongfully convicted in 2003 ended tragically on the shoulder of Interstate 95 in South Georgia on Monday morning.

On Wednesday, the Camden County, Georgia, sheriff’s office released body-worn and dash camera videos of the moments leading up to the shooting.

In the dash cam video, the deputy begins pursuing Cure with his sirens on after Cure’s vehicle passes his. The pursuit lasts about one minute and 20 seconds.

In the video, the deputy tells Cure to get out of his vehicle and says he pulled him over because he was speeding and driving recklessly. “You passed me going 100 miles per hour,” the deputy says.

“I’m not going to jail,” Cure says at one point. The deputy responds, “Yes, you are going to jail.”

The deputy orders Cure several times to put his hands behind his back, warning him he will be tased if he doesn’t. When Cure doesn’t comply, the deputy tases him.

While being tased, Cure turns and begins walking toward the deputy and grabs the Taser wire. The two engage in a physical struggle for about 20 seconds, during which Cure grabs the deputy’s throat and face. The deputy strikes Cure multiple times with a baton and Cure is heard saying, “Yeah, b*tch,” as the struggle goes on.

The deputy appears to fire his weapon and Cure falls to the ground. The gunshot is not audible in the videos.

The deputy is heard saying, “Camden, shots fired,” into his radio while he still commands Cure to stay down. Cure can be seen sitting up at times and flailing his arms. The deputy is then seen unpacking a first-aid kit and appears to begin administering aid until paramedics take over.

Cure later died, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.

The sheriff’s office said it released the videos to be transparent “regarding the actions that occurred” and to show the “confrontation and use of force.”

The GBI has said it “will conduct an independent investigation of the incident and turn its findings over to the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office for review.”

CNN has reached out to representatives of Cure’s family.

Water usage on the Colorado River is way down as the West begins planning for a future with less

As the Biden administration kicks off a years-long negotiation process to divvy up the shrinking water supply of the Colorado River, there are finally some signs of optimism after several bleak years.

A record-breaking winter snowpack last year halted a precipitous downward spiral on the river and raised water levels at the nation’s two largest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell.

But something else is also at play this year – farmers, cities and Native tribes are simply using less.

Arizona, California and Nevada’s usage of Colorado River water has hit new lows, state officials and US Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton told CNN in an interview.

“The record conservation is already seeing its impact within the reservoirs,” Touton said. “It’s easy to see our success within the levels of the reservoirs we manage.” Lake Powell has risen 52 feet since hitting a low point in February of this year, while Mead has risen nearly 23 feet since November.

Driver who crashed into Chinese consulate in San Francisco tried to stab a responding officer before being fatally shot, police say

The driver who crashed a blue Honda sedan into the Chinese consulate in San Francisco last week was armed with a knife and had a loaded crossbow in his car before he was shot and killed by police, authorities said Thursday.

Zhanyuan Yang, 31, rammed into the lobby area of the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China on October 9 just after 3 p.m. local time, San Francisco Police said last week. At the time, police said there were no other injuries.

On Thursday, the San Francisco Police Department held a town hall where it addressed details about how the attack on the consulate unfolded. Officials played 911 calls and body camera footage of responding police officers.

One video shows an officer arriving at the scene and running into a building inside of which appears a blue sedan has crashed. As the officer makes his way farther into the building, the camera moves closer to a man dressed in a blue T-shirt and pants while covering his face. Eventually, the man is pushed against a wall, as a voice is heard asking him if he’s armed with a gun. Seconds later, an officer fires his gun at the man, who then collapses onto the floor.

“As the sergeant and the security guard pinned Mr. Yang from behind against the wall, Mr. Yang rotated toward the sergeant and the security guard and exposed the knife in his right hand,” San Francisco Police Acting Cmdr. Mark Im said at the town hall meeting.

“Mr. Yang made multiple, rapid downward swinging motions with the knife towards the direction of the sergeant and security guard,” Im added.

Attorneys for Richard Allen, man charged in Delphi murders, have withdrawn their legal representation

Richard Allen, the man charged in the 2017 killings of two teenage girls in Delphi, Indiana, no longer has legal representation, Judge Frances C. Gull said during a Thursday hearing.

Allen, who is accused of killing Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13, was being represented by defense attorneys Brad Rozzi and Andrew Baldwin.

The attorneys withdrew their representation of Allen on Thursday in an “unexpected turn of events,” according to Gull.

“Mr. Baldwin made an oral motion to withdraw,” the judge said during the hearing, which lasted only a few minutes. “I granted that oral motion to withdraw, and Mr. Rozzi will be submitting a written motion to withdraw, I’m assuming, within the next couple of days.”

Gull said she would reach out to public defenders to appoint new counsel for Allen, who was arrested last October after a five-and-a-half-year nationwide search.

The bodies of the teenage girls were found in a wooded area near a trail in February 2017.

San Francisco security guard will not be charged in fatal shooting of suspected Walgreens shoplifter

The security guard who shot and killed a suspected shoplifter at a Walgreens in downtown San Francisco last month will not face criminal charges, the district attorney’s office announced Monday, saying the shooter acted in self-defense.

The district attorney’s office under Brooke Jenkins released surveillance video and a written report Monday regarding Michael Anthony’s fatal shooting of Banko Brown on April 27.

According to the report, the guard said Brown had repeatedly threatened to stab him prior to the shooting. Police did not find a knife in Brown’s possession, the report states, but prosecutors still determined his fear was reasonable.

“Given the totality of the circumstances, including the threat that Anthony believed, and could reasonably believe, the evidence shows that Brown’s shooting was not a criminal act because Anthony acted in lawful self-defense,” the report states. “Thus, Anthony is not criminally liable for the death of Brown.”

However, Brown’s family attorney John Burris told CNN’s Sara Sidner that the guard’s actions were “way beyond what was reasonable and necessary.”

“Stopping someone and talking to them is different than stopping them and beating them up and ultimately killing them,” Burris said on Tuesday

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors last week sent a letter asking District Attorney Brooke Jenkins to release the surveillance video showing the shooting after no charges were brought against the guard during the 72 hours he was in custody.

GOP-led states and industry groups ask Supreme Court to block Biden’s ‘good neighbor’ pollution rule

A group of Republican-led states, fossil fuel industry groups and utilities filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court Wednesday, asking it to block the implementation of the Biden administration’s “good neighbor” rule – a regulation to cut down on harmful smog and air pollution that wafts downwind and across state lines.

The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to occasionally review and revise the interstate pollution rule to make sure it aligns with the latest health guidelines and science. The EPA strengthened the rule in March under a court-ordered deadline, after it languished without update during the Trump administration.

The revision required 23 states that weren’t meeting the requirements to adhere to the rule, which prevents smog and air pollution from power plants and heavy industry from floating into other states and worsening air quality. For instance, if one state generating ozone and smog through its coal-fired power plants sends these pollutants into another neighboring state, it could be in violation of the rule.

The rule is being challenged in multiple courts, but so far none of those cases have successfully blocked it. In their application to the Supreme Court, the Republican states and industry groups say the Biden EPA plan threatens the reliability of the nation’s electric grid. The court will likely ask for a response from the EPA before taking action on the request.

More than 60,000 Fortress gun safes recalled after dozens of reported breaches, including one that allegedly left a 12-year-old boy dead

Thousands of biometric gun safes are being recalled due to concerns they can allow unauthorized access, federal officials said, citing a lawsuit alleging a 12-year-old boy died from a firearm obtained from a breached safe.

More than 60,000 biometric safes – which use body-specific information to grant access – manufactured by Fortress Safe are under the recall notice after at least 39 reports of safes being accessed without the correct fingerprints, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. Such safes’ brand names include Fortress, Cabela’s, Gettysburg and Legend Range & Field, it said.

“Consumers can believe they have properly programmed the biometric feature when in fact the safe remains in the default to open mode, which can allow unauthorized users, including children, to access the safe to remove hazardous contents, including firearms,” the commission said in the statement announcing the recall.

Most children who die from accidental shootings in America are playing around with guns at home or mistaking them for toys, a scientific study published this year found. Guns have been the leading cause of death for children and teenagers in the US since surpassing car crashes in 2020.

Consumers are advised to stop using the biometric feature on recalled safes, remove the batteries and rely on the key for recalled safes used to store guns, the commission said.

Fortress Safe posted a tutorial on YouTube explaining how to disable the biometric feature. A recall form is also available on the company’s website to request a free replacement.
