Instagram Adds Helpful Label Indicating Point Where Girlfriend Stops Appearing In User’s Pictures

In an effort to improve user experience, Meta announced Thursday that the next update of Instagram would include helpful labels indicating the point at which a girlfriend stops appearing in the posts of a given account holder. “Starting today, some Instagram users will notice a beta rollout of this new feature, which will appear as a thick black line demarcating the date beyond which a person’s girlfriend is no longer pictured,” said Meta representative Hailey Coogan, noting that all 2.5 billion active users of the social media app would be barred from opting out of the feature. “Our goal is to streamline the primary activity people engage in when they visit Instagram. In addition, we hope to cut down on users accidentally liking posts from five years ago when they are scrutinizing every photo in an account to figure out if someone was single at a particular time.” Asked why Instagram did not simply add a place to indicate relationship status in one’s profile, Coogan acknowledged this would result in people spending no more than a few seconds at a time on the app.

Humane Meat Company Hires Assassins To Quietly Slaughter Cows In Their Sleep

Addressing the need to incorporate more humane practices at its facilities, Cargill Meat Solutions announced Thursday that it had hired assassins to quietly slaughter cows in their sleep. “In order to reduce the suffering of livestock, trained hit men will creep into the pens of cattle late at night and compassionately terminate each animal before it even realizes what’s happening,” said CEO Brian Sikes, explaining that the consortium of highly skilled assassins would approach cattle as they slept and use a gun with a silencer to discreetly execute the animals as they lay dreaming in peace. “Other assassins will be in the pen with the cows for hours, lurking in the darkness, waiting until the right moment to strike with their ninjatō. The quiet snap of a branch or the click of a door opening may cause an animal to stir slightly in its slumber, but the contract killers will move at lightning speed before the cow’s brain can even register the disturbance, allowing our customers to be satisfied knowing the meat they are eating experienced no pain.” Sikes added that while they were still alive, the cattle would continue to experience the same inhumane conditions as always in the meat-packing plant.

Encouraging Study Finds There Still A Bunch Of Kids Who Haven’t Been Shot Yet

Providing a sense of hope about the gun violence epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new study Wednesday that found there were still a bunch of kids in the United States who had not been shot yet. “We reviewed the data, and yeah, it turns out there’s a ton of kids who’ve never had a single bullet wound,” said CDC director Mandy Cohen, who breathed a sigh of relief at a press conference as she shared the encouraging news with reporters. “Pretty great, huh? Yeah, I was surprised too, but there are children all over this country who have never experienced the sensation of being shot with a firearm. Ideally, no kids would be shot, but it’s important to look on the bright side of the data. Plenty of young people haven’t even been grazed yet.” Cohen added that, for the time being, there were still some American children out there who hadn’t so much as witnessed a shooting.

House Elects Kevin McCarthy’s 8th-Grade Bully As Speaker

Awarding him the position solely on the basis of his proven ability to torment his predecessor, the U.S. House of Representatives elected Kevin McCarthy’s eighth-grade bully Todd Jenkins as its new speaker in a landslide vote Thursday. “When you consider his impressive track record of putting Rep. McCarthy in headlocks, shoving him into lockers, and giving him cruel nicknames like ‘McCunty,’ there is no candidate better suited to lead the House,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) said of Jenkins, a 59-year-old tire salesman of unknown political affiliation who quickly unified the GOP caucus in a 220-1 vote and, in his first act as speaker, hit McCarthy in the stomach with the House gavel as hard as he could. “Time and time again, he has shown himself to be a true abuser of Kevin, and we were impressed with the way he took time to meet with all our congressional colleagues to talk to them about how our former speaker is both a ‘fat little bitch’ and a ‘homo retard.’ He’s already brought a bill to the floor on whether to hold McCarthy down in the speaker’s chair and fart in his face, a measure that passed overwhelmingly.” A press time Jenkins was seen knocking the House calendar out of McCarthy’s hands and telling him to pick it up.

DNC Concerned After Poll Shows Only 15% Of Americans Have Heard Name Joe Biden

Spelling trouble ahead of the 2024 election, Democratic National Committee officials were reportedly concerned Monday after a new poll showed that only 15% of Americans have heard of the name Joe Biden. “A full 85% of American voters just looked at us with a blank expression on their faces when met with the name ‘Joe Biden,’” said Gallup pollster Mary Townley, whose report left top Democratic strategists anxious and distressed as the election drew nearer, but nonetheless determined to go forward with Biden’s candidacy. “The vast majority of Americans sounded out the name ‘Biden’ like it was a foreign word. According to our research, U.S. voters were utterly confused, even when shown a photograph of Biden standing in front of the White House. Furthermore, only 5% of the 15% of Americans who had heard the name ‘Joe Biden’ reported that they had any opinion on him whatsoever.” At press time, the DNC was even more panicked after learning that Biden’s name recognition hovered at just 3% among registered Democrats.

Parents Repeat Word ‘Gentle’ While Toddler Rips Dog’s Ear Clean Off

In an apparent effort to turn the incident into an instructional moment for their curious 1-year-old son, local parents Josh and Lisa Cohen repeated the word “gentle” Wednesday when the toddler ripped a dog’s ear clean off. “There we go, Mason, very good job petting the doggy,” said Lisa, who then demonstrated the technique by running her hand along the shaking, shrieking schnauzer’s back as the toddler simultaneously dug his nails into the dog’s head, pulled as hard as he could, and immediately tore off an enormous, bloody chunk of flesh. “No, no. We don’t pull on the doggy, because he doesn’t like that. See how doggy doesn’t like having all the skin torn off his skull? Now, what do we say Mason? We love you, doggy! Now, let’s give him his eyes and ears back and go.” At press time, the toddler reportedly had a meltdown after he went to hug the dog, ripped open its abdomen, began disemboweling it, and was quickly dragged away by his parents.

Liberal Woman Genuinely Fascinated By Man’s Experience Being One-Eighth Puerto Rican

Exclaiming with delight when the revelation arrived 30 minutes into their dinner together, local woman Sophia Davis is said to have grown genuinely fascinated Monday after her date mentioned that he was one-eighth Puerto Rican. “Oh, wow, really? That’s so interesting—that must have colored your childhood in ways that were both enriching and challenging,” said Davis, who reportedly shifted her chair forward with evident interest upon hearing her date mention that one of his great-grandmothers was a white-passing Latina woman who had lived in Puerto Rico until the age of 15. “The interesting thing for me, Tim, is that I’ve actually never dated a Puerto Rican guy. Am I pronouncing that right? Tim? Just tell me if there’s an accent somewhere I’m missing. I’m sure you deal with enough frustrations with people not really grasping the complicated relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. Do you ever go back and visit San Juan?” At press time, sources said the man had shrugged after another round of drinks and decided to tell Davis that, yes, he had met Lin-Manuel Miranda several times.

Report: 90% Of Fast Fashion Ends Up Wasted On People Who Can’t Pull Off Look

Amid the continued popularity of clothing retailers like Shein and H&M, a new report published Thursday by the Boston University School of Public Health found that nearly 90% of fast fashion items end up wasted on people who can’t pull off the look. “We’re finding that the vast majority of cheap, unsustainably manufactured clothes are destined to be strewn across the body of someone who’s totally kidding themselves if they think they can make it work,” the report read in part, concluding that the immense damage fast fashion inflicts on the environment cannot not be justified when the product almost always winds up in a pile on the floor after the customer realizes they don’t have the body for it. “Although fast fashion is appealing to consumers because of its price and availability, the global population predominantly lacks that ‘it’ factor required to really rock the style. Even when a shopper does achieve the level of conventional attractiveness necessary to look good in one of these garments, it’s only a matter of time before they eat a big bowl of pasta and default back to the one shapeless, oversized T-shirt they feel they can hide inside. For the sake of the planet, our society needs to invest in fashion that looks more or less okay on everyone.” At press time, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions released a policy paper recommending substantial fines for any apparel company that manufactures anything other than a proposed universal sack.

Pet Dog Forms Unlikely Friendship With Oncoming Pickup Truck

Having not left the vehicle’s grill since they met, local pet dog Duke has formed an unlikely friendship with an oncoming pickup truck, sources reported Tuesday. “Aw, whoever would have thought a 5,000-pound F-150 going 90 miles per hour and an adorable little puppy would become so close?” said onlooker Linda Boyes, pointing out that the 2-year-old schnauzer and the speeding automobile have been inseparable since their chance meeting on a stretch of state Highway 26. “I love that, despite how different they are, this dog and truck still somehow managed to get together. Did you see how the pickup was even going over the speed limit to get to his buddy quicker? So precious!” According to neighborhood sources, this is the most adorable thing to happen in the area since a brood of baby ducklings mistook an Amazon truck for their mother and followed it down the block until the driver eventually had to reverse and backed over them.

Biden Urges Americans Not To Let Dangerous Online Rhetoric Humanize Palestinians

Upon returning from his brief diplomatic trip to the Middle East, President Joe Biden urged the nation Thursday not to let dangerous online rhetoric humanize Palestinians. “As the war between Israel and Hamas rages on, I urge my fellow Americans to remain vigilant, and not fall for any false propaganda that claims people living in Gaza and the West Bank are worthy of human life,” said the 46th president, adding that since the war had begun, U.S. intelligence had discovered countless bad actors flooding the internet with reports that many Palestinians were mothers, fathers, and children who were not terrorists and did not deserve to be trapped without food, water, or fuel while being carpet-bombed into submission. “If you hear a Palestinian being described with terminology like ‘son,’ ‘daughter,’ or ‘in desperate need of medical attention,’ then you should be aware that what you are reading has been specifically designed to stoke empathy.” At press time, Biden added that Americans should also avoid dangerous propaganda that wrongly asserts the billions of dollars in military aid the United States has sent to Israel could be spent on things like healthcare, education, or alleviating poverty at home.
